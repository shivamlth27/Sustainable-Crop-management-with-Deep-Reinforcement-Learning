## Project Overview

This project is designed to provide AI-driven solutions for fertilizer recommendation and crop recommendation. It includes Python scripts for model creation and inference, along with an HTML-based user interface for crop recommendation accessible through a web application.

## File Structure

- **ai-model:** This directory contains files related to the AI models used in the project. These files may include model checkpoints, configuration files, and training scripts.

- **AI[1].pdf:** This PDF document likely contains additional information, such as research papers, documentation, or technical specifications related to AI concepts or models used in the project.

- **app.py:** This Python script is the main application file. It likely contains code for setting up the web server, handling user requests, and integrating the AI models for crop and fertilizer recommendations.

- **cr.py:** This Python script is likely related to crop recommendation. It may contain functions or classes for processing crop-related data and making recommendations based on AI models.

- **crop_model.py:** This Python script likely contains code for creating and training the AI model specifically designed for crop recommendation. It may include data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation code.

- **crop_recommend.py:** This Python script is likely another component of the crop recommendation system. It may contain additional logic for recommending specific crops based on user inputs and model predictions.

- **datasets:** This directory likely contains datasets used for training and evaluating the AI models. These datasets may include historical crop data, soil information, weather patterns, and other relevant agricultural data.

- **fr.py:** This Python script is likely related to fertilizer recommendation. It may contain functions or classes for processing soil and crop data to recommend suitable fertilizers based on AI models.

- **label_encoder.pkl:** This file is a serialized object (likely created using Python's pickle module) that stores a label encoder used for encoding categorical variables in the dataset.

- **model.pth:** This file likely contains a serialized version of the trained AI model (e.g., a PyTorch model checkpoint) used for crop recommendation or fertilizer recommendation.

- **Readme:** This file is a placeholder and currently empty. It may be intended for additional documentation or instructions.

- **scaler.pkl:** This file is a serialized object (likely created using Python's pickle module) that stores a data scaler used for scaling numerical features in the dataset.

- **static:** This directory likely contains static files used in the web application, such as CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images.

- **templates:** This directory likely contains HTML templates used for rendering the user interface of the web application. These templates may include pages for input forms, result displays, and other UI components.

- **__pycache__:** This directory contains Python bytecode files (.pyc) generated by the Python interpreter. These files are automatically created and used by Python to speed up the execution of Python programs.

## Running the Code

1. **Install Dependencies:** Before running the code, install the required dependencies by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

This command will install all the necessary Python packages listed in the `req.txt` file.
`pip -r install req.txt`

2. **Run the Application:** Once the dependencies are installed, run the main application using the following command:
   **Run Code** `python app.py`

3. **open in browser** - open localhost:5001

This command will start the web server and make the application accessible through a web browser.
